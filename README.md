## II. Goals
Simulate the movement of a throwing ball on a rotating system. (eg. Earth)

## III. Steps
1. Depicting the ball and the rotating planet at initial condition.

2. Calculate the Coriolis force acting on the ball.

3. Present the simulation by a video.

## IV. Assignment
1. 楊添福 -> Formulate the Coriolis force acting on the ball.

2. 黃景岳 -> Find out the solution of the movement equation.

3. 謝明儒 -> Export the animation of the throwing ball.

4. 鄭銘健 -> Debug and check thework of vpython code.

## V. Work Log
Week 1:
1. Install vpython and look out the difference of it.
2. Formulate the motion of the throwing ball.
3. Solve the equation and observe how it moves.

Week 2:
1. Define all the constants we need in this project.
2. Set up input format, containg latitude, velocity, and duration.
3. Generate three windows to show our later detail works.

Week 3:
1. Import the figure of Earth to be as our rotating system.
2. Let the Earth rotate at constant speed and connects to the other two figure.
3. Fire the ball and draw the trajectory 3-D on the main window and the others.
4. Add some extra controls, such as changing fire angle and perspective.
