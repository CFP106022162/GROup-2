## II. Goals
Simulate the movement of a throwing ball on a rotating system. (eg. Earth)

## III. Steps
1. Depicting the ball and the rotating planet at initial condition.

2. Calculate the Coriolis force acting on the ball.

3. Present the simulation by a video.

## IV. Assignment
1. 楊添福 -> Formulate the Coriolis force acting on the ball.

2. 黃景岳 -> Find out the solution of the movement equation.

3. 謝明儒 -> Export the animation of the throwing ball.

4. 鄭銘健 -> Debug and check thework of vpython code.

## V. Work Log
Week 1:
1. Discuss and organize our final project goal.

Week 2:
1. Install vpython and look out the difference of it.
2. Formulate the motion of the throwing ball.
3. Solve the equation and observe how it moves.

Week 3:
1. Define all the constants we need in this project.
2. Set up input format, containg latitude, velocity, and duration.
3. Generate three windows to show our later detail works.

Week 4:
1. Import the figure of Earth to be as our rotating system.
2. Let the Earth rotates at constant speed and connects to the other two figures.
3. Set a circular plane as the Great circle where the throwing ball only due to force of gravity.

Week 5:
1. 
2. 
3. Fire the ball and draw the trajectory 3-D on the main window and the others.
4. Add some extra controls, such as changing fire angle and perspective.

Week 6:
1. 
2. 
3. 

Week 7:
1. Check our progress whether it suits the reality.
2. Beatify our video and refine our vpython code.

Week 8:
1. Double check our code and finish our PPT.
