## 2. Goals
Simulate the movement of a throwing ball on a rotating system. (eg. Earth)

## 3. Steps
1. Depicting the ball and the rotating planet at initial condition.

2. Calculate the Coriolis force acting on the ball.

3. Present the simulation by a video.

## 4. Assignment
1. 楊添福 -> Formulate the Coriolis force acting on the ball.

2. 黃景岳 -> Find out the solution of the movement equation.

3. 謝明儒 -> Export the animation of the throwing ball.

4. 鄭銘健 -> Debug and check thework of vpython code.
